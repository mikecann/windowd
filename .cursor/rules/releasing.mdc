# Releasing windowd

## Version bump + commit + tag

1. Bump `version` in `package.json`
2. Commit: `git add bin/cli.ts package.json ... && git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z."`
3. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
4. Push: `git push origin main --tags`

## npm publish

Publishing is handled automatically by the **npm Trusted Publisher** (OIDC) flow - pushing the tag triggers it via CI. Do NOT run `npm publish` manually.

The workflow uses `--provenance` with `permissions: id-token: write`. Do NOT add `registry-url` to the `setup-node` step - that writes an `.npmrc` expecting `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` which conflicts with OIDC auth and causes a 404. No secrets are needed in the repo.

## Versioning guide

- Patch (0.x.Y): bug fixes only
- Minor (0.X.0): new features or meaningful UX improvements
- The project is pre-1.0 so minor bumps are fine for anything non-trivial
